<p><b>Diego Maradona</b>, in full Diego Armando Maradona, (born October 30, 1960, Lanus, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died November 25, 2020, Tigre, Buenos Aires), Argentine football (soccer) player who is generally regarded as the top footballer of the 1980s and one of the greatest of all time. Renowned for his ability to control the ball and create scoring opportunities for himself and others, he led club teams to championships in Argentina, Italy, and Spain, and he starred on the Argentine national team that won the 1986 World Cup.

Maradona displayedbotball talent early, and at age eight he joined Las Cebollitas </br></br><i><b><mark>(“The Little Onions”)</mark></b></i>, a boys’ team that went on to win 136 consecutive games and a national championship. He signed with Argentinos Juniors at age 14 and made his first-division debut in 1976, 10 days before his 16th birthday. Only four months later he made his debut with the national team, becoming the youngest Argentine ever to do so. Although he was excluded from the 1978 World Cup-winning squad because it was felt that he was still too young, the next year he led the national under-20 team to a Junior World Cup championship.</p>
<p><blockquote>Maradona’s career with the Argentine national team included World Cup appearances in <u>1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994</u>. He dominated the 1986 competition in Mexico. In a 2–1 quarterfinal victory over England, he scored two of the most memorable goals in World Cup history. The first was scored with his hand (the referee mistakenly thought the ball had struck his head), a goal now remembered as the “Hand of God” goal. The second occurred after Maradona gained possession of the ball at midfield and dribbled through a pack of English defenders and past the keeper before depositing the ball in the goal. He did not finish the 1994 World Cup, because he tested positive for the drug ephedrine and was again suspended. Maradona also played on South American championship-winning teams in 1987 and 1989.</blockquote></p>
<P>The trophy cup awarded from 1930 to 1970 was the <cite><b>Jules Rimet Trophy</b></cite> named for the Frenchman who proposed the tournament. This cup was permanently awarded in 1970 to then three-time winner Brazil (1958, 1962, and 1970), and a new trophy called the <code><strong>FIFA</strong></code> World Cup was put up for competition. Many other sports have organized <em>“World Cup”</em> competitions.</p>
<p><blockquote>In 2008 Maradona was named head coach of the Argentine national team. Shortly after leading Argentina to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup, he and the country’s football governing body could not agree on a contract extension, and his tenure as the team’s head coach ended. In 2011 Maradona was hired to coach the <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> club Al Wasl. However, the team struggled, and Maradona was fired the following year. He worked for several other clubs before becoming coach of Mexico’s Dorados de Sinaloa in 2018.</blockquote></p>

  <p>In his illustrious club career, he played for Barcelona, Napoli, and Sevilla. However, he started his career in Argentina with Boca Juniors. He made his debut for Boca on February 20, 1981. He won the Superclasico against River Plate and also bagged the league title. However, in 1982, after the World Cup, he was signed by Barcelona for a then world-record fee of £5 million. In the Clasico, he was applauded by the Santiago Bernabeu crowd for his goal where he dribbled past the goalkeeper and then stopped before the empty goal as defender Juan Jose came sliding in. Maradona maintained his composure and then pushed the ball while Jose crashed against the post.

In 1984 he joined Napoli and then propelled the team to the most successful era in its history. In 1986-87, he won the league, the first for Napoli. The attacking trio of Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca was known as the "Ma-Gi-Ca". In 1987, he won the Coppa Italia, followed by a UEFA Cup win in 1989, and the Italian Supercup in 1990. In 2000, the number 10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired. Whereas, on December 4, 2020, nine days after the legend passed away, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.</p>
